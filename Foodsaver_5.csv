5,i like and they work! yaaaay! no more wasted food! We purchased 3 foodsaver machines for ourselves and family and we'd like to know how we can redeem our FREE CHEF ESSENTIALS SET COUPON!!!
5,One of the best storage containers. Easy to seal and the design greatly facilitates storage of the empty containers.
5,My vegetables lasted three times longer when I started using the Ten Cup Fresh Saver. I also bought the three cup and the five cup. I would recommend selling the bottom parts with the Fresh Savers as they are needed often.
5,"These are fabulous! I kept salad in the largest one for over 2 weeks. At the end of the time, the salad was just as fresh. Great product!"
5,"Have been wishing for larger containers and am thrilled with this one. Easy to use, you do have to pull a bit hard to open it. Loved it so much and bought the set of 5. I like that they are clear and that they have the seal indicator on the top to assure a complete seal"
5,These containers were probably the best that I have used with my Food Saver. All of the containers work very good the 3 cup 5 cup and the 10 cup have been used several times now both in the freezer and microwave and I have had no issues . I would recommend these to everyone get them you will really enjoy them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

5,This container surpassed all my expectations. I put grapes in it sealed it and three weeks later they were still firm and fresh. I love it
5,"I am very pleased with my purchase. Two words simplicity, and efficiency!"
5,Bought a set to try out the features. Over product features and benefits an A +. Already saving cash preserving fresh fruits and vegetables. Will continue to use and highly recommend to purchasing public.
5,I am very happy with new style container. Much more ridged then earlier container. Holds a tight seal very well. Great for loading cut up veggies and use later as needed.
5,"Thought they would keep produce for a week, but it actually has kept cucumbers for over three weeks...and counting! Positively awesome!!!"
5,Head of lettuce...three weeks still good. Cherries still like just picked after a month. Leftovers indefinitely. Works well with my older sealer. Easy to clean. Gonna buy more.
5,"I bought this a couple of months ago or so, and use it continuously. It holds a small head of lettuce. I use it a lot for chopped raw vegetables that I snack on during the day. They stay fresh and crisp all week."
5,"I absolutely love the FoodSaver Fresh containers. Not only are they nice to look at, they are very durable and keep the food fresh in the fridge. They also clean up great without any filmy look."
5,like these the best they really help preserve fruit cheese etc stored in refridgerator
5,I've used these to store cookies and a week later they were still as fresh as the day they were made.
5,I have been using these containers for about 2 weeks now and could not be happier. They are super easy to use and definitely extends the shelf life of leftovers. Highly recommend! Note I received this product in exchange for my honest review of their product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,Bought this set hoping to keep my greens and spring mix fresher longer. This set has not left down with wasted food. Keeps all crisp and ready to use. Great product!
5,I really like the new fresh saver containers. I keep my celery in this one. It stays nice and fresh.
5,My fresh fruits and veggies last so much longer since I started using the containers. I'm now able to buy more in bulk and thus save money.
5,Just bought this container along with the produce tray. My greens have stayed nice for 9 days and counting!
5,KEEPS LETTUCE FRESH AT LEAST 3 WEEKS MAYBE MORE.OUTSTANDING!!!!!
5,I received these foodsaver products as a sample and wow they work great it makes a great addition to an already existing foodsaver products or would make a great starter and definitely save money by keeping leftovers longer This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,All that I expected. This is a lot more solid than I expected it to be. It stays sealed for over a week at a time which I had read other canisters lost their seal after a short while. Very good and solid product.
5,"Purchased 4 weeks ago, but wish it was slightly larger to hold the one pound container of spring mix sold in stores."
5,Very happy with these products and store well in refrigerator!
5,They work wonderfully! Very easy to store Food really does last longer I love these so much I bought them for my best friend
5,"My wife and I have been looking ( for a very long time ) for something to keep lettuce (Romaine )from going bad This is it we make a salad and it stays fresh for weeks.( 2 or more )easy to use seals the first time everytime,Great product"
5,"Kept my oatmeal raisin cookies soft for 2 weeks, by then they were all gone"
5,Can't believe how the portion sizes work for my pantry! I keep checking to see if there is any pressure loss and they remain tightly sealed! I will be ordering more for leftovers soon.
5,These work very well. Keep the food very fresh. I will be buying another set soon along with the produce trays that go with them. I was unaware of the trays until after I received the set or I would own them already. Most
5,"Fruits and vegetables stay fresh for days, I love these containers."
5,I absolutely love these containers and highly recommend them! These are so well built and are a major improvement over the previous containers which were so flimsy and never closed or sealed properly. These are so sturdy and versatile. They seal the food perfectly and they look beautiful as well.
5,"Have had it for two weeks or so, it is sturdy, nice quality plastic and works great. Only drawback is in the users guide. It tells you to press the sides down until they click. They don't click. Press firmly and they work great."
5,I love it for small fruit items such as blueberries. I have more use for the larger containers so will have to buy more of those.
5,Bought these hoping they would replace the bags. To my Surprise they are better. I have put Lettuce in One it is still good after 3 weeks.
5,This I like the way this product looks and works. It is easy to seal and unseal. I also like the see through design and the size.
5,"I use the new Food Saver the new containers every day for fresh food for my parrots, plus my DH and I. Works very well, no wasted food, can see what is inside. I purchase things in bulk like coffee, parrot pellets, meat, vegetables, even berries and they all store very well with the food saver, either the bags or containers. Imagine keeping boysenberries and blueberries for 3-4 weeks (doled out 2 at a time for the parrots)--it's true."
5,I bought those over a month ago and am very happy with them. They are the right sizes and stack nicely in cabinet and frig.
5,Never realized how much food I threw away until I got my food saver containers wished I had done this years ago.
5,These containers are easy to use to put items in on a daily bases. They are quick and easy to vacume and pop into the refridgerator and then when you are ready just put it in the top shelf of the dishwasher and done.
5,The trays help to keep foods fresher by elevating them off the bottom of container.
5,Have had a Food Saver for about 18 years....great product!
5,"I purchased the set, I have green onions in the long container. I bought a six pound bag of green onions as we use a lot of them. The container wouldn't hold all of the package so I put some in a locking plastic bag. By the time we finished the ones in the bag, the tops were beginning to wilt but the ones in the fresh saver container were still great."
5,"The food saver vacuum storage units are excellent performers. When you first take them out of the box you will be impressed with how sturdy these containers feel. Restored a variety of food in these containers. From fresh baked cookies to last nights leftovers to ground beef, the food saver units definitely prolonged the life of the food. The units are microwave safe and able to be stored in the freezer. Put them in the dishwasher when they're dirty and don't worry - they won't melt. Overall we were very pleased with these storage containers and will get a lot of use out of them in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,This is an amazing product. Easy to use and keeps food fresher then anything else I have ever tried.
5,I bought 2 of them and a week later went back for more and also ordered some online.
5,"I had some problems with this product sealing. I wrote a review about this and received a response asking me to call customer service about my issue. I called customer service and they went above and beyond to make up for my dissatisfaction. I have been a customer for years and this is the first time I have received a product that wasn't 100, but the awesome customer service made up for it."
5,"I've owned a Food Saver for many years, but the old Food Saver I had finely gave out and I purchased a new one. I had always used just the rolls and made my own sealing bags, sealing my meat purchases. When storing left overs I usually would just put them into a glad ware or like product and stick it into the fridge. Since my husband passed away I no longer cook big meals, but still like to buy in bulk when I can to save a few dollars. So when I discovered that Food Saver had vacuum food containers (ok, so I'm a little slow) I was excited to say the least. I jumped into this new convenience with both feet. I purchased 3 of the NEW FoodSaver Fresh Container, 4-Piece Set's. Wow, their great. Now when I purchase a good size bag of lettuce greens I can count on the lettuce greens lasting all the way till I finish them. No longer does it turn into a frazzled edged limp bag of Euck. Now I can buy the big container of sour cream and transfer it to the big seal container and it will last what seems forever. I now use my seal a meal containers for everything. When I open a big can of carrots, peas, green beans, etc., I can now seal the rest in a container and not have to worry that it will go bad before I can use up the rest. I love the way they look, so clean and neat looking. I can find everything I need in the fridge. My next purchase is going to be to buy some more of the smaller containers, I can't seem to get enough of those. Food Saver, you've done it again. Congratulations on a great product."
5,"I ordered this about a month ago. I love them. They really keep cut up lettuce fresh, for way over 3 weeks, without it starting to turn brown. In fact, I ordered another set."
5,"These are a great solution for things that spoil quickly. I bought my first one specifically for strawberries and I had a batch of strawberries last 3 weeks after storing them in the 8 cup Fresh Container. These are very well made and so much easier to use than the earlier deli containers. Just keep all the sealing surfaces clean and dry before vacuuming. I also like using the 8 cup container for bagged salad so that it doesn't get crushed in the refrigerator. I now have all the sizes and bought the produce trays, too. These are worth the price."
5,I bought this a month ago and am pleased that I did. The item seal and keeps my food fresh.
5,Bought these months ago and keep produce in them. They are great
5,"I have only used in once, but I am sure I will use it again. It is easy to use"
5,"Theses containers are the best, they don't stain or etch like the cheap plastic ones that come in the packs of 5. I have used them for spaghetti and tomato sauce heated in the microwave (without the lid of course) and they have come completely clean without etching like the cheap ones every time. They are definitely worth the cost as they will last a long time. I use the hand held sealer with the included adapter to help keep the food fresh much longer."
5,"I've been using these containers since they were first offered for sale. I now have several and use them for fresh fruits, veggies, and a variety of leftovers. They keep the food amazingly fresh. Although they extend the life of the food, it still needs to be used in a reasonable length of time. My raspberries usually stay fresh only a couple of days. The Fresh Saver extends that fresh taste up to a week."
5,"You must use the tray at the bottom of the container for proper circulation to keep the food fresh. Plus, you must clean the lid seal and container's edge that mates with lid seal to ensure a tight fit with no leaks."
5,I've been using Food Saver canisters to store vegetables and produce for years now. The new Fresh Containers are just as good at preserving the freshness but they are stackable!! Green beans stored in the largest container were crisp and fresh 5 days after harvesting from the garden. Leaf lettuce stayed in the smaller canisters for almost a month and was still fresh and flavorful. Really like the space saving rectangle and square design.
5,"I rate this product overall as 5 stars, even though the lids can require a little oompf to get off once the vacuum seal is released. The reasons I provided 5 stars are: They hold up well. No staining (even when reheating spaghetti), no dishwasher detergent melted white spots, no residual smells (even after garlic. They do what they say they will do, keep your food fresher longer. * I did receive this product as a sample to review, however I would purchase again. And will be adding more containers soon. * This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,These are so easy to use! I love that they keep my fresh veggies for so long. I would recommend to anyone looking to prolong the life of their fridge foods.
5,I bought this set and I am thinking about buying more. My produce stays so fresh for so long.... I do not care for the deli keepers. They are not deep enough and it's hard to get a seal . But I will buy more of the produce containers!
5,"Having read some not so great reviews, I was hesitant to order these. Great for fresh fruit leftovers, and have had no problem with them not retaining a vacuum. The Marinator container is a must have!"
5,these containers are more excellent ways to save food from spoiling.
5,This keeps vegetables and fruit really fresh . I wouldn't be without it. Love it!
5,"Haven't had a chance to use them yet, but I believe I will find them very useful."
5,Love these containers! They are easy to use and keep my food fresher longer. Only wish they came in more (especially smaller) sizes!
5,"Perfect for salads and leftovers, highly recommended"
5,"These containers exceeded my expectations! Not only are they durable and easy to clean, but I was able to keep my everyday foods fresher longer. I used them for lettuce, red chile, cookies, leftovers, and deli meat. In just a few weeks I was able to save money because I didn't have to toss out food that went bad. There are a good variety of sizes for the containers, which makes it easy to store a wide variety of items. Overall, these containers are amazing and I highly recommend them for anyone that wants to cut down on how much food they throw out each week because they can't keep it fresh. I received this product as a sample to review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"I feel the food saver containers performed perfectly. The various sizes are perfect for a wide array of storage. The 10 cup I used to store extra hamburger buns. We normally end up throwing extra ones away but the food saver I have been able to reuse them later. As of two weeks in I have not had to throw any food away. I have went from fridge to microwave, serves food and not had any issues. There has no staining nor odors which is something I have not seen before. The food saver containers will allow for easy storage and a lot less waste in any household. I know I plan on replacing all my storage containers with food saver products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"I love these new canisters. They are nice looking and seem to hold up well, so far. The new dimple feature is great. I lets you see if the vacuum is taking place, by indenting as the vacuuming process is taking place and also lets you know, at a glance, if the seal has been maintained over time. I've only had one instance of vacuum failure. I also like the curved corners, which let you squeeze down on the lid to ensure proper closure and the nesting feature, which is an improvement over the old canisters. With the old canisters, you can only nest different sizes. Same size canisters cannot be nested and take up a lot of space. The only small negative about these is that when releasing the vacuum, the lid is a little difficult to remove, but is tolerable, considering the overall improvement in the design. I only have one suggestion about the canisters. I would like to see some additional configurations for the 5 and 8 cup canisters, more like the 10 cup, which is horizontal rather than upright. In a horizontal design, a 5 and 8 cup canisters could be used for things such as cold cuts. In the present configuration, cold cuts can't be laid out. In addition, they are a more difficult fit in the lower shelves of my fridge. I'm not suggesting a replacement, but an addition to the current lineup. Overall, these are the best containers Food Saver has ever made, by far."
5,I bought this to save money by freezing leftovers for future use.
5,Family lo especially it keeps our fruite fresh....
5,"I've had these about a month or so and I use them all the time. From fruit to cheese and meats, these containers are great!!!!!"
5,Bought this to put cut up lettuce into. But found that the Celery fit better without cutting it up into short pieces.
5,They seal well and easy. Best of all they keep the vacuum and the food is kept fresh. We are very happy with the set.
5,I have used all 4 of them and love love love them.... Not only do they keep food fresh they look awesome in the refer!!!
5,Great. LOW LOW LOW PRICES.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,What I like about the container are that they are easy to use and wash. They stack up nicely. They bet having all those other container that you can never find the covers for. Will be getting more of them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,"Had it for over a month, great seal and food stays super fresh, just like the day I got it. even after a week or two."
5,Love this product. A well as all their products. Company stands behind their products. Would not be we out food saver products
5,I bought these containers about 1 month ago and I love them! May have to order more!
5,"I really loved the food saver storage containers. They were easy to use, attractive, and kept the food fresh for a longer period of time. I liked the 10 cup size for produce and baked goods. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,The sizes and stackable feature are what makes this product work for me.
5,"Love the sizes. Great for Berries to veggies, long or short. The inserts are great so fruits and veggies stay dry."
5,"Haven't used this yet, but it seems to be perfect for what I wanted"
5,"great for fruit,leftovers or anything else.Well made Product."
5,The convenience of everything from the bags to the canisters work great.
5,I love the size of this container and the quality of the material is sturdy!
5,Just got this and I am excited to use it. It looks durable.
5,strong seal food is truly saved lettuce remains crisp love these new containers the shape is great too you can stack them
5,"I wanted them because I get leaf lettuce and the larger one is great for that. The others I treat fresh fruit with vinegar and water, drain a little and put it in them. Now I have blackberries and blueberries. Keeps them from getting moldy and unusable."
5,"I can't begin to express my love for this FoodSaver container. I find it more convenient than storage bags. It's so nice to place leftovers in the container and vacuum seal it with in-lid indicator showing it is sealed. I was impressed with it's versatility as I stored chopped onions without any odor leaking stored sugar in the pantry without bother by ants stored and reheated chili without any staining on the container. My sole use of my FoodSaver in the past was to bag up steaks and chicken, but this container will find me using it much more often! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"I purchased these about a month ago and am so happy. I struggle to find food containers that I like and these fit the bill. Thick, durable BPA free plastic keeps vegetables fresh for a very long time. I had several ripe cantaloupes in the garden, I cut them up, sealed them in one of these containers and they have lasted for a really long time without smelling up the refrigerator. Very happy with the product!"
5,"I am very happy with these items. They keep my food fresh and usable so much longer. Example: Strawberries lasted way over a week, no more spoiled or ruined grapes, carrots holding up really well. I am very, very pleased with how they are keeping my fresh produce."
5,I bought these containers because the old ones were so hard to seal. These seal easily and are good sizes. Finally a great product.
5,I love these. They truly work. As a single person I just can't eat things fast enough. Now I use my new containers and food stays fresh long enough for me to finish it and not throw it out. I like them so much that i bought more.
5,"I have been having a horrible time even buying fresh lettuce lately. I had to use what I could in a hurry or it was brown. With the long container, it kept for days until it was all gone and soooo crisp. The containers nest so easily for storage too. I would recommend these to a friend."
5,"I'm glad to now have the two produce trays. I pressure sealed strawberries with and without inserting a produce tray in the storage container. With a tray inserted in the storage container the strawberries kept fresher and longer. The tray helped any moisture to drain down, away from the fruit, thus preserving the fruit more efficiently. Wish, however, that these tray came together WITH each unit. I AM pleased to have them."
5,"These containers are dead simple to use, and actually live up to their lofty marketing. Their versatility and design make them far more useful that normal storage containers, and it feels like food would last many times longer in the fridge than with a zipper bag or other storage. If I'm picking nits, the smallest container (3 cup) is a bit small but works for leftover berries etc. The other sizes will probably get more use in my house. Overall though, these are fantastic storage containers that will likely save you money in the long run This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"Purchased this to see if I would reduce the amount of waste with lettuce. I'm happy to report, that since I purchased this item, I no longer have to put the bad leaves in the compost now or feed them to the hogs as we have no losses. I'm going to purchase a couple more for other leafy items as well."
5,"As a single person I bought one set of various sizes a while back and liked them so much I wanted more. First of all, they are very sturdy and you can see through them, unlike some other brands of containers (opening something that's green and fuzzy isn't fun). Another feature is you can use them either vacuum sealed or not, freeze or microwave reheat in them. I had strawberries in one for a bit over two weeks that were still good. What more could a person want"
5,"I bought a lot of container from food saver, and by far this are the best I bought so far. They are very easy to clean and store. Unless you come out with something better, all the rest I have are gone."
5,"I have been using these is both the freezer and the refrigerator to store produce. In the freezer, it keeps berries at the perfect place until I have enough to make jam. In the fridge, my fresh vegetables last longer and stay firm. Easy to clean and easy to seal."
5,"This really works. I got 5 times the life out of my greens. The only thing I suggest is if you have several days between uses, simply open, toss around a bit and reseal. This will extend the life. The one time I didn't open And use for a week, I noticed the greens went bad a little faster."
5,I have used a couple of the new containers and in my opinion they have a much better seal. It's easy to see the food within the container and I'm impressed with the great new design.
5,I think it is great that it can go in the freezer. It is easy to clean in the dishwasher. I use them daily.
5,For someone like me a Chef. These containers are fabulous! I can now make everything home made and preservative free and even finish the entire meal!
5,"Very happy with my purchase, bought about a month ago,easy to use, works very well ! keeps its seal, and so far , no cracks in the container!"
5,"I bought this set, and am really impressed with the results after having used them. I would highly recommend them to my friends."
5,"As a food save fanatic, this set is AWESOME! Works great for many uses."
5,"The FoodSaver containers are great - they keep food amazingly fresh! They are durable, easy to clean, and very functional. The only thing j would change would be the overall aesthetics - the design could be finessed a bit to make them look more elegant rather than looking like something you would use in a science experiment. Otherwise I think the quality is good and they perform as expected. I received these as a sample to evaluate. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"These are just the best.we do allot of canning, and I'd great for dry canning."
5,"I was very sceptical about buying the fruit and vegetables container. When I received it I immediately used it. To my surprise, it actually kept my strawberries and grapes fresh for almost 3 weeks. I did not open once I vacuum sealed the container. I am not sure how long the fruits and vegetables will last when you break the seal and then reseal it. I will be purchasing a few more today."
5,So happy to have these in our pantry. We are using them to store nuts that we purchased in bulk. They stack great to save space and so easy to seal.
5,"I love the Foodsaver sealer but sometimes I want access the sealed items and seal them back up without wasting bags. These containers are the perfect solution. They are very easy to use and very obviously show if the container is sealed right on the lid. The sealing function is quite obvious, plug and seal, and takes just a few seconds. I appreciate the multiple sizes of the containers as they are large enough to fit almost every need. In my fridge they did take up a decent amount of room so I'm not sure I'd use them often for long term fridge storage. I do use them frequently for pantry storage (crackers/cookies) and freezer storage (cookies/scones). The clear containers allow you to easily see what is inside. As much as I appreciate the storage aspect I do have to say that the microwave usage surprised me. They performed great in the microwave, the food warmed and the container did not! I was shocked. Clean up was a breeze too, even spaghetti sauce left for days did not stain these containers. You can pop them into the dishwasher and they clean right up. The only negative I can think of is that the vacuum valve cover is a little difficult to remove, I wish they had added a little grab tab or something to assist in removing. But since you only remove this to clean the top lid, I suppose its a minor inconvenience. Disclaimer: I received this product free as an advance sample in exchange for a detailed and honest review. This fact that has no bearing on my rating or review of the product - this product has earned the rating I have given it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"I purchased these containers a month ago and have to say they are every bit what they are advertised to be! I am extremely pleased with them. Easy to use, high grade materials, no more wasted kale or lettus! This product is worthy of its claims."
5,Great product. Will purchase more down the road. Wish they had different colors to pick from
5,"I bought these right away. I have discarded many of my previous containers because they have cracked even though I am careful how I treat them. I hand also found that they do not always hold their seal. These new containers are far superior, l bought 2 complete sets. I hope all new food savor containers will be made from this new material going forward."
5,"I have bought nearly every style of Foodsaved container produced, these new freshwater containers are the best. Just being able to put the lids in the dishwasher is the best improvement but, also the way they stack and nest for storage is also a great feature. I am really pleased with the new design."
5,I brought home fresh sugar snap peas and placed them in my new container with the produce tray. It's been over a week and they are as fresh as the day I bought them. This will save me a lot of money and keep foods fresh rather than having to be thrown out. I love these new products!!!
5,Wish I could afford another set. Maybe next summer!!
5,I love these containers. They keep my food fresh for a much longer time than any other containers I have used. They are stackable so they are easy to store. They do not stain when putting pasta sauce in them. They are dishwasher and microwave safe. They are clear which allows me to see what is stored. They are a must have for anyone who has a foodsaver appliance. I received these for free for my honest opinion. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,These containers are far superior to anything that has been put out in the past. I love the dimple that proves the container is sealed.
5,"I love these containers. Prevents squishing of softer items (as would happen in a bag) , is really easy to see when the seal forms, and is easy to open afterwards. Also saves on cost as you are not using bag after bag. Great for items you want just a little of and want to reseal again."
5,I have been using the food saver canisters for approximately 15 years now and these are by far the best! They are so heavy duty and the fact that you can stack them in the refrigerator surely does help space wise.
5,Bought the set and found it easy to use and quite effective. A great way to store my summer pesto and tomato sauce for the winter months when the fresh tastes will be appreciated
5,"Bought a few weeks ago, I got all 4 new items like this, all super good, great seal and use them for any thing I store. My only compliant is when I purchased all four items it was not available in a set of four like now. I ended up paying 14 plus dollars more than you buying them initially than now when you can get the same as I bought in a set for that much less."
5,"I've used these just a few times, they keep strawberries much longer, love them."
5,I like how they go together and they are very easy to use and they're simple to release the pressure to open. great idea.
5,These work extremely well and are far and above superior to the canister set!
5,I purchased the two piece set as a starter just to determine for myself whether or not the items would perform as advertised. I have used both and have found to my delight that in fact both work as described. My half avocado did not turn brown over night. I will now buy more.
5,"I love these new foodsaver containers! They are so much better than any other vacuum seal containers I've tried in the past (and I've tried a few!) The plastic is durable and high quality I stored pasta sauce in it and it didn't stain or retain any odor. I microwaved it and ran it through the dishwasher (bottom section only) and they came out good as new. They are very easy to use with the adapter and the foodsaver vacuum hose although I would recommend running the vacuum sealer a little longer than when the indicator indents to make sure you get a full seal. They maintain a tight seal until you release and everything I store in them stays fresh for so much longer. They also have bigger sizes than any vacuum seal containers I've ever used so you can even make big batches of soup or chili and be able to store them in these much larger sizes! Just a word to the wise, the tight fit of the lid--which allows for the great vacuum seal--can make it a little tricky to open the containers if they are full of a liquid like soup or chili. Overall I love these containers and would recommend them to anyone that has a foodsaver vacuum sealer! I received this as a free sample to review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,I bought these containers because I thought they were what I was looking for since I have gotten rid of all my Tupperware. They are exactly what I was looking for. As soon as I can afford another set I will buy them.
5,I love this system for baked goods. It stays fresh longer and does not spoil. These containers are made of good quality and stay air tight.
5,Put a salad into the fresh container and left it there to see if and how long it whould stay fresh. after 2 weeks I opened it and it was still fresh and had not turned brown.
5,I bought these about a month ago and love them. I have only my sealer a couple of months and have been very happy with it
5,I bought this to use with my food saver containers to store lettuce. The only problem is the food saver container isn't deep enough to store much. So I've only used this item on one small batch of romaine lettuce and it did work well keeping the lettuce fresh.
5,"I have had this group for about a month now and they are absolutely excellent. I love fruit but it tends to go bad too quickly in the refrigerator so usually buy in very small amounts. I bought a large group of green grapes and stored them in one of these containers and although it took me a while to finish the grapes they were all still very firm and delicious. I prewashed them and had pulled them all off of the vine prior to putting them in my container also so very convenient. You don't even have to remove the air from the container for most fruits too. Salads are wonderful also and stay good. Usually just make what I need for a meal but now am able to make more at a time, store it, remove the air, and it stays good. Very easy to do also. Thanks!!!!"
5,They are great. They are great. There are also great.
5,I have been using my Food Saver for years and love it. The only problem was the bags crush and suck the juice out of the fruits and vegetables so I didn't use it for them. This new Fresh Container works great. Problem solved! Thank you
5,Salad stayed fresh 3 weeks in the biggest container have used the others for various things with excellent results
5,I love Food Saver products and these containers are just another reason I do. They are so clear and convenient and stackable. You can see exactly what you are storing. The insert to keep food off the bottom is a great idea too.
5,"Stored sliced zucchini I couldn't use before leaving town for 2-1/2 weeks. Few days after coming home opening container, was pleasantly surprised zucchini was as fresh as day I sliced them. Just wish produce trays came with container even at a little higher cost. You were out of stock and can find no where in stores near me. Hope you have them when I place another order to meet free shipping minimum."
5,These containers are well thought and full of quality. I like all sizes and the square shape does not waste space. They are stain resistant even with spaghetti. Easy to use and dishwasher safe is a nice touch. The Tristan plastic is durable and tough. My food stayed fresh and tasted better longer. The clear design is nice also to see what is inside it. I give this an overall 5 star rating because all around d great product. I received a sample of this product in exchange for a review. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,"These containers hold their vacuum seal, and they have great capacity."
5,Maybe they upgrade some small areas after people complained a while back. My experience with this set is that it has no issues. I do a lot of batch cooking to save time and money. This helps!
5,I recently purchased the food saver containers and I really enjoy them. I have stored things from rolls to veggies and they keep longer. I would recommend them to my friends and family.
5,"The Food Saver containers worked great. They easily went from fridge to microwave to dishwasher. The clear plastic allows you to see the food inside so the containers don't need to be opened to check on the food. The seal held tight and the pop-in button made it easy to see when the vacuum seal was done. They are a little tough to open when the seal is released, but overall, great containers. I received a sample of this product to test and it did not disappoint! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"Review: The food saver fresh containers are overall an excellent product, very durable, good style, ultimately keeps food fresh longer. Pros: Keeps food fresh longer Good style Let's you know when it's sealed Works with existing food saver sealers Microwave, dishwasher, freezer safe Cons: Heavier than average container Can be hard to open even with no vacuum seal Somewhat bulky compared to other containers Can be more expensive per container than other solutions This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,I recently purchased this set and it has already paid for itself! No more fresh berries and greens thrown out because they couldn't be consumed in a short period of time. We are eating so much healthier over a longer period of time.
5,These containers are excellent! Well worth the money!
5,These are very useful and very easy to use. They keep food fresh longer and they even stack in your refrigerator. My wife loves them and we are very glad to have purchased them. I give them an A+
5,"This product clearly exceeded my expectations. Food easily kept fresher longer and would maximize my food savings. The system was easy to use and I was clearly able to see when all the air was removed. The containers did not leak, stain, retain odors, or shatter while holding any of the five types of foodstuffs I stored in them. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. Note: I did receive this product for evaluation purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"I like these for strawberries or salads. This helps keep those fresher, less soggy, and crisp. I would buy it again."
5,I BOUGHT THIS SET ALONG WITH 3 OTHER ITEMS. I LOVE ALL OF THE FOOD SAVER CONTAINERS AND BAGS. THIS SET IS A GREAT SIZE FOR LEFTOVERS AND FRESH FRUIT.
5,These are the best food containers I ever used .Keeps my fruits and vegetables fresh for two to three weeks
5,"Foodsaver vacuum storage containers are definitely a money saving value. They are easy to use with the Foodsaver vacuum unit, and as I was asked to try these with different foods in different situations including microwaving and dishwashing they thoroughly kept my food fresh and cooked without staining or breaking. I'm looking forward to trying many different foods with the storage containers, since they seal easily and have kept food fresh remarkably over the last few weeks. I tried putting salad mix in the large 10-cup container and remarkably it stayed much fresher than the unsealed bag I got from the store. I tried it in the freezer and in the refrigerator with both leftovers and deli products in it. Great products, great value. I received this as a sample to try but would definitely purchase it without question. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,I am thrilled with these. I put celery in one of them 18 days ago and it is still extraordinarily crisp.
5,I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and they work great. I'm very impressed on how it kept my food fresh. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,"I haven't used them yet, I can't afford the sealer for them."
5,Just the size that I was looking for! Great for fresh veggies which we have every night with our meals. My husband tells me he loves how fresh they taste so do I. :)
5,Keeps bread and bagels very fresh for a couple weeks.
5,I have and love the whole Food Saver System because I can put all kinds of food into the containers and they stay fresher longer than anything I have ever used. I use all the containers and also the bags. The bags take less room in my freezer so I fit more in it and the products that I freeze stay fresher and look good with bright colors than other forms of freezing bags that lose their color and the meats turn brown. I am so glad that I changed all my storage containers and bags to Food Savers because we enjoy fresh food all the time. I will keep buying the bags and the containers. I stock up when I see sales too. Good deals.
5,We own tow sets of these containers. I'd own a third if I could buy a larger fridge.
5,Love these!!! A quality product. Onlywish you had one more smaller size.
5,"I have been pleased with the way these containers have kept fresh veggies and other foods fresh. Just a word of advice, be sure to read the directions carefully. There are some foods that produce gases like broccoli and cauliflower that interfere with the seal. They are very easy to seal and open."
5,"After buying these, as well as all the sizes offered, I purged my plasticware collection. These stackable containers take up a lot less room and are great! I handwash the lids, to avoid disassembling them."
5,My celery has stayed fresh and crisp twice as long in the container then not using one.
5,I bought this along with the produce trays and have been very happy with how long my salad greens stay fresh. Making salad has never been so easy and convenient. So pleased with this product that I plan on ordering the 10 cup size.
5,These are wonderful! They work so well and keep my food fresh longer. They are easy to wash. I use them for storage of fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge.
5,I decided to purchase this product to fit the containers purchased for Christmas and they only make my food saver containers better.
5,I purchased the 4-piece set and I am thrilled with the function and design. The sizes of the containers are perfect and adding the tray makes great storage for my fruits and vegetables.
5,Prior to have this 10 cup container a lot of my lettuce would go bad before I could use it all. I have only had it fro a couple of weeks but have already saved money.
5,Received these for Christmas. Used for Christmas leftovers and almost every day since. No problems with sealing or opening. Big fan of Foodsaver products. Cleaning takes a little longer than normal food storage containers but it is time we'll spent. Watch for sales for greater value.
5,"I bought these about a month ago. I love these items. I buy in bulk, so Food Saver saves me money. I am a household of 1, so when I cook, I cook more than 1 serving. With Food Saver, I can save the other servings for another dinner. I have owned a Food Saver and accessories for at least 20 years."
5,I have used the FoodSaver bags off and on for years now and always wished there was a reusable container for the freezer. I love these new options. I buy lots of frozen fruit and veggies that turn to ice fairly quickly if left in their original packaging. The vacuum seal bags kept the ice off but tended to mash delicate things like berries together. These containers are perfect for them. I have had fresh picked blueberries in 1 for about 2 - 3 months and there is no ice buildup and no problems with the seal. I also love that I'm not throwing away as much plastic! I will definitely be buying more of these!
5,Love these! Great tight seal. I sealed lemon wedges and they were still as fresh as the day I sealed them day after day until I used them all after 5 days. Wish they would make the storage canisters out of this material.
5,"I love these storage containers. They definitely keep food fresh for much longer than any other container I have owned to store produce items and cooked items in the refrigerator. They will be great in the freezer, as well. I like that fresh berries last for more than a few days. the largest keeps lettuce very fresh and crisp. Easy to use with the Food Saver appliance. I use these every day. As an added bonus, they resist stains!!!"
5,I now have every size really use the small one the most. I even put a sharpie black dot on the edge that seems to hold best of the lid body. I've had whole jalepinos for approx 3 wks and no mold or softening thus far. Love them.
5,Dishwasher safe and the vacuum indicator are 2 extremely valuable upgrades to the vacuum canisters.
5,I plan on buying another set when I can get the money.
5,I am amazed! My grocery bill has gone down about 20 when using these. My food stays fresh so much longer. I wish I had gotten these sooner.
5,All the FoodSaver products I have purchased are great. I love the bags and now these containers. Thanks much!
5,"keeping the air out of my peppers, shrooms spinach makes them last so much longer"
5,"I bought them because of the sale price, but I love having containers that actually keep food fresh. I was able to cut up fruit the day before so it was all ready for breakfast with company."
5,"I bought this containers about 2 months ago ,and I am happy I did ,with just my husband and I I wanted our produce to last longer and it sure does keep veggies fresh longer , I bought 3 sets so I use them for everything, I'll write another review with a picture in a month when I buy my new frig."
5,"All the reviews sum it up: thicker plastic, user friendly in stacking (empty or full), square size design, doesn't retain color/odor of food, good quality of plastic, improved gasket on lids, improved device/mechanism on lid top for sealing/vacuuming, from counter top to frig or freezer, dishwasher safe, smooth plastic finish, info on bottom (cup size etc.), bigger/larger designed 10 cup size more suitable to storing larger size loafs of bread,and many more improvements from previous containers. I bought 6/7 of each size and use everyone of them for something (dry/wet items). The BIGGEST improvement is the BUBBLE/SEAL on top to indicate a seal. You just check the bubble and that's IT. So simple. They are worth the extra ., you'll get your moneys worth every time you use them, and they are just F-A-N-S-A-T-I-C. Very highly recommended."
5,Bought two sets to replace some older containers. These are vfery high quality and durable. HIghly recommended
5,"Although I haven't had these very long, it seems I can already tell the difference in the length of time that the food stays fresh in these vs. regular food containers. I got the largest one specifically for storing salad greens, as i get so tired of throwing away half a container of salad that has gone bad before i get it eaten! So far, I'm not disappointed, and the salad still appears to be very fresh - even after a week or so. That's a big savings to me. I was a little disappointed that the little green grate didn't come with had to be ordered separately, but i still give it 5 stars for product design, durability, and function."
5,"We bought these a month ago and are very happy with the results. We notice right off how much fresher our fruit and vegs. are, and how long they keep. It was good buy, as before we dump so much food that spoil on us."
5,SURE HOLDS VACUUM LONGER THAN THE MARINATOR. LOVE IT
5,"i got 3 other containers that hold a good amount, but they all have a crack in them and i like them the best. they should be guaranteed."
5,I bought food saver and containers over 5 months ago and I really love this appliance. I have save about 150.00 in groceries since I purchased this system.
5,"Great for what they are designed for. My wife thinks I'm nuts for buying them, but they do keep the bugs out and our coffee beans do retain their glossy, flavor coating. What I don't like are the zipper bags. Bought a bunch because I saw the reuseability function - but they will not keep a vacuum the second time around. I thought that was what they were designed for, but . . . . . the manufacturer wrote to me and said they were only intended to be used once. A direct quote from FoodSaver (JCS Customer Service), The zipper bags are resealable for every day use, however we do not recommend that they be washed and reused because it might compromise the ability to create a proper vacuum. Go figure."
5,"I have been using this since I purchased it and am truly amazed how fresh my produce is staying. I currently have celery in it, but I have to say that you should also invest in the produce tray as I did. Keeps the produce up from the container to keep air circulating. Love all my containers."
5,I purchased a number of food saver containers because I was tired throwing my hard earned in the trash. So far I am extremely pleased with the shelf life of the vegetables I've placed in them. Previously I only froze items so this is new to me.
5,I purchase a few weeks ago and have used repeatedly. Love them. Much better than standard plastic ware.
5,"We love these so far. Kept lettuce, strawberries so fresh,"
5,I make extra with the Slow Cooker and use the container to store the left overs.
5,It keeps fruits and vegetables much longer and is so easy to use.
5,"I ordered this set plus extras a while back. What a wonderful find. I can tell the suction on the containers works great. Salad , fresh veggies., and fruit are lasting much longer. I was having a time with the salad greens going bad in a few days of opening the bag but it has been over a week and looking GOOD!"
5,I bought this about 2 months ago. Really like putting leftover food in bags and containers to save for a later meal.
5,I use the largest container to keep my celery. I lop off the bottom or top to fit. It keeps the celery so beautiful crisp. Tnx!
5,"In spite of the fact that I have had a FoodSaver for years, when I bought a new one, I was introduced to the Fresh Containers. I LOVE THEM!! They keep food fresher longer, are easy to use, easy to clean. Eventually, every storage container I have will be a Fresh Container!"
5,"I would give these containers a 5 star rating overall. I have found myself storing products in these containers that I normally would not. Lunch meat is amazing several days longer than normal which will save my family money because I'll be able to buy more in bulk. I love not having to add any water to my stored prepped vegetables. Normally I have to add a little, I always thought it was normal, but with these containers I didn't have to. None of the moisture escaped and no fridge flavors snuck in. I used the 10 cup storage container for my prepped vegetables and loved the fact that on Sunday I was able to prep for the entire week and they were still in fantastic shape and flavor after that full week. I used the 5 cup for my long grain white rice and after being stored in the pantry I was amazed by the freshness that was apparent from the big aroma of rice that hit me when I opened the container. I have enjoyed the ease of use and how stackable they are. Amazing for storage and being stored. I was able to try this product for free and very thrilled that I had this experience. I definitely need to get more of these containers. Fabulously fresh food and easy organization. Five star all the way! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,"These new design of containers are the best ever, and knowing they have kept the seal reduces waste from old design."
5,Love that I can by salad again and it's not bad in 2 days
5,My bagged salad now lasts 7 days without wilting. We buy bagged salad and it now lasts 7 days without any signs of wilting.
5,So easy to use keeps cucumbers and peppers fresh for almost 3 weeks. I've purchased 2 sets so I always have them on hand. I highly recommend
5,"I'm sold on this product. I now have purchased 6 pieces ready to order more. I found for some reason I get a good seal the first time when certain corners are placed together. (This is probably just a mental thing) lol , so I put a black dot on a corner for both top bottom. I've found that wiping built up moisture on some things (jalapeos) off every week, they stay even fresher longer."
5,"I bought this set over a month ago. Really keeps veges, salads, etc. much longer then any other way of storing I have tried. Love that I don't have to cut up more salad every couple of days. By using these containers easly keeps for the week even though I open, close and re-vacuum seal them several times."
5,"My wife and I are the only two people in our house. We were throwing away more than 25 of our food and leftovers because we could not eat them fast enough. We bought two sets of the FoodSaver Fresh Containers and now we throw nothing away. Herbs, berries, fruits and vegetables stay crisp and fresh for literally weeks instead of being limp and useless after two days. Along with the reusable vacuum bags, we have a terrific system. The accessory vacuum hose is in daily use at our house now. The entire system and the containers have already paid for themselves."
5,"My containers arrived right before I left on an extended vacation the beginning of the summer, so I had to wait to use them... bummer! I have just these last 2 weeks been able to start using them, and 3 containers are in use right now! I was frustrated with the design at first until I realized you REALLY had to press hard to close the lids so they would vacuum properly. Once I saw the little button on the lid sink in, I knew I was in business! (You'll know what I mean when you use yours for the first time!) And the way the accessory locks onto the lid is so much better than the old smaller containers. This product really ROCKS!!"
5,I found these containers to be very useful. They seal so easy with no problem and hold the vacuum seal until you use the contents. Very easy to use with my food server. Easy to clean.
5,these dishes are great and the visual indicator for the vacuum is great.
5,These seal much better than the older version and are well designed.
5,"I bought these 3 months ago and absolutely love them. I can now have my fresh fruit last longer. Strawberries and Raspberries last 3 weeks (or until I used them all). That was so great since they usually last maybe 1 week before they would mold. Celery, carrots and lettuce all stay fresh. I loved them so much I bought a set for my daughter. Like me she cannot see herself not using them. I no longer have to throw produce out. I have used FoodSavers for many years and have saved money. Thank you for another great product. A little pricy but will save that much 10 times over because of the food I will not be throwing away."
5,"I really like these you can cut up a salad and separate them for a week and they stay fresh, love them!"
5,"I bought these a month ago and have had the time to use them and get used to them. I had one lid that was not holding the seal. I tested the lid by switching it with another container -- it was the lid. I removed the value (watch the video) and now that lid is working fine. I bought these containers primarily for lettuce because that is the one fresh food item that frequently spoiled. I love the 10-cup for lettuce. My husband doesn't like how hard they are to open but he's getting used to it. I use these containers for strawberries, blueberries, baby carrots and the produce does stay fresher."
5,Absolutely awesome products but they should also have the green bottoms included even if it raises the price. No sense in having one without the other.
5,I ordered 2. Love them for coldcuts and cheeses...nice seal system maintains the vacuum.
5,"I have been using these for a little while now. They seal well, stay sealed and keep food crisp. I have been using them for fruits like watermelon and grapes so far. The green grapes were crispy just like the day I bought them. The watermelon did not age like it would have if I had put it in anything else. I release the air, wait a couple of seconds and release the air again (especially with the big one) that make the lid much easier to get off. I like these and hope they last for a long time."
5,"I added this to my growing number of Foodsaver containers a couple of weeks ago and it exceeded my high expectations. The new containers seem sturdier than my previous ones. With only two of us, berries especially get soft and are thrown out. With the first use and filling it to the max with strawberries, not one was discarded. With daily use and resealing after each use, the berries stayed firm. Green beans did just as well. My 5 cup container does just as well with blueberries or anything else I have tried. I will be purchasing more for my weekly Farmer's Market purchases.They will pay for themselves in a short time."
5,I bought these a month ago and am pleased with their quality and how fresh they keep even berries! I'm am tossing less fruits and veggies because of these.
5,"Works as I thought, keeps food longer in the refrigerator and we are happy with them."
5,"I'm tired of throwing out food, and I saw the foodsaver on an infomercial. I'm single and it is hard to cook for one. I love chili but not every day so I can eat what I want and use the foodsaver to store the rest till I want it again. I would recommed to a friend."
5,I have only used the container for fresh strawberries. I am disappointed that the green tray was not included. Why Tupperware would never do that........ So what I do is put a piece of folded up paper towel in the bottom in place of the tray. Seems to work okay. M.
5,I find the container is great for fresh fruit preserves them easy storage.
5,I purchased this to freeze asparagus from my garden. It is the perfect size and would highly recommend it
5,I bought these to keep my salad items fresh. Can prep a weeks worth of items without worrying about them spoiling. Definitely makes salad making easier!
5,"This time of the year we really enjoy salads and thanks to FoodSaver Fresh Containers, we can now keep fresh cucumbers an extra couple of weeks and Iceburg lettece for about the same time in the refrigerator. Now we can buy in bulk and save money!"
5,Use it for my salad items. Stays fresh all week so salad is like I just go it.
5,I live by myself and in the past had to throw food out because I could not eat it all before it went bad. Now I don't throw anything out because of products from Food Saver. Great product!
5,"We now have nearly a dozen of these containers in various sizes and, thus far, have found them to be far, far superior to the round canisters. The stackability of these containers is quite handy, and the vacuum/no-vacuum indicator button is a wonderful addition, resulting in a generally quick indication in the event that a container has lost its seal. The above notwithstanding, we have had an occasional, albeit quite rare, sealing issue with these containers, all of which were quickly rectified by disassembling the vacuum port on the lid, including removing and cleaning the rubber seal valve itself. All in all, we are as highly satisfied with these containers as we were highly disappointed with the constantly cracking round canisters."
5,"I cut up strawberries they were still firm and fresh as the same day I cut them a week later, wow !!"
5,"I L-U-V the new 3 cup. The reviews (by FS) say IT ALL. New, refreshing, a USER (very much welcome on this end) friendly design. New and improved design (top lid) of button for sealing/vacuuming. Crack, shatter , stain odor resistant. Dishwater, microwave, and freezer safe. Stacks full or empty. Clear plastic for transparency to view contents. New produce traps (interchangeable between 3,5, 8 c/c) allow one to store produce. Newly designed gasket on top lid. They must BE GOOD/IMPROVED because the supply could not keep up with the demand. I was ecstatic when you could once again order the size (includ 5 cup acc. hose) and where no longer greeted with OUT OF STOCK, NOT AVAILABLE (eeyesss/yeahhhh!!!!). VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,"Just like all food saver products,they are great.Thanks"
5,reusable and great price. can be used for anything
5,I am new to this product and i love it i kinda went crazy buying all this but it wroth every bit of it. thank you
5,I am so pleased to have purchased these containers! I feel so good about not wasting anymore food! I wish I had done this years ago!
5,These containers are excellent for storage. I would recommend the Food Saver over any other brand on the market.
5,"I've been a FoodSaver patron for years and years. I am on my 4th sealer (upgrading) and love the machine, the bags, the savings. But I've seen things like these containers before and haven't been happy in the past. I reluctantly decided to give it a go. I am so impressed. They do just what they promise. My shelf life of vegetables has doubled or tripled in some cases. This is a huge savings for my wife and myself as it is just the two of us and we just can't use up the produce fast enough sometimes. I've already ordered a second set and some individual pieces. I know what I am going to be giving for Christmas this year to some of my FoodSaver friends."
5,I got this set as a gift. They are terrific. Keeps my vegetables so fresh. I am no longer having to throw out my fruits and vegetables. Saves me so much money and so easy to use. I highly recommend
5,"I love these containers. They seal so well I had to have my husband open one. As a produce farmer he pulled out the green pepper broke it heard the fresh snap as he did and asked me how old it was. I commented on this was a test of freshness and the pepper had been in the container for 3 weeks. He was more impressed than I was since I use these on a daily basis. Being a household of 2 I needed something that would keep my cheese, sour cream, salsa etc and found the containers perfect for all of it. Love the small round one for sour cream for sure. Actually I love them all. I use my bags for freezing. I have a hand held at work and home. I am a FoodSavor junkie."
5,Have been using these for month or so and they keep fresh greens and fruits very fresh. Easy to use and stack well in my small fridge..
5,I bought a set last month and already impressed with them. I put my celery in one and 3 weeks it is still fresh. I love them as much as I love my Food Saver machine.
5,I purchased these and they were so great that I had to order another set for all my food saving needs
5,These containers keep fruit more fresh than I can believe!
5,I love the storage sizes. Store easily and I use them for everything from lunch to leftovers
5,"I bought this specifically for the fresh fruit and vegetables of summer. I was tired of the fruit going bad before we could eat it, or the vegetables loose their crispness. I have not been disappointed! Currently I have blueberries, raspberries and blackberries in containers as well as cauliflower, carrots, radishes and green peppers. Highly recommend to others. I have two sets now and my refrigerator has never been so organized.......my husband loves it!"
5,"After a little difficulty on how to seal these, I really like the crisp lettuce, peppers, etc. I am able to keep well over a week. Glad I purchased."
5,"I have bought a few of these dishes, My husband and I both just love them. They seal up great...Keeps foods fresh, I make meals up ahead of time and freeze them...I also make up some single portions and freeze. So easy to use. I would highly recommend Foodsaver dishes and their Foodsaver Vacuum sealer / bags. We have saved tons of money after buying our first Food Saver Vacuum sealer."
5,"I bought them to freeze servings of dinner to bring to work. I am very happy with how well they work! I like to make my own frozen dinners rather than buy store bought frozen meals, and foodsaver products have been worth every penny!"
5,I love the new size of the 5 cup container. It is very sturdy I love that I got it just in time for berry season!
5,"We bought this set a month ago, and absolutely love them. Foods stay fresh longer, color remain bright, and maintains nutrients . We liked them so much we purchased five more containers two 8 cup, two 5 cups and one 3 cup. Use them constantly. Great product"
5,I purchased these while on sale. I've put strawberries in them and they stayed fresh
5,"Wish they came in more sizes! Can see contents, sturdy, stack-able. Would love to replace ALL my storage containers w/these."
5,These are just the right size for most leftovers that we have and are great for keeping them fresh
5,"I love these containers! So convenient and versital, and clean-up is a breeze! I use them daily!"
5,"Overall we love them! It did take us a while to remember to use them in the fridge, but the results are dramatic it the shelf-life of fruit, produce, and even leftovers. We are ordering more."
5,"Perfect for storing spinach, carrots, cheese, lunch meat etc."
5,Love my food saver keeps fruit a long time I have an autistic grandson who loves strawberries and comes here after school when I bought it the sale was buy 1 get 1 free so I got 2 sets
5,"I bought this to store veggies that are shaped like celery, asparagus...etc... and as expected it works great. Thanks for the quality products."
5,Better than Rubbermaid. Why does the review have to be so long
5,These containers keep my fruit fresh for weeks. I love them.
5,"I bought this set thinking maybe I'd get an extra few days out of my produce. To my surprise and delight, I'm getting an extra week or two!!! This is especially good because I'm on a limited income - No more moldy berries and mushy fruits and veggies! The money I've saved in 1) have produce I can use, and 2) not having to buy again the next shopping trip has paid for the container already, and I've only had them for about 2 months!! SCORE!"
5,"I threw away all other containers that I was using to store left over food when I received my shipment of FoodSaver containers. Most of that food ended up just getting thrown away because it just didn't keep very well. These FoodSaver containers work wonderfully sealed or not. There are some foods that shouldn't be sealed because of tha natural release of gases so for those things I still use the FreshSaver containers, I just don't vacuum seal them. Food tastes as fresh as the day it was made. These containers are also stain resistant so much more so that other containers I have had.... Any time I have stored stainable food (like chili or spaghetti sauce) the containers have become stained. Not these!! It comes right off with no problems and I don't have a dishwasher to help me...."
5,"There are only two of us. I feel so relieved that we can purchase food items, such as quality meats on sale in large packages for us. It is easy to package. Plus the packages are so clear in the freezer, there is no question of what type of meat it is...no freezer frost or burns. We love it!"
5,I have used this several times. It keeps your food fresh longer
5,We bought them about a month ago and they work as advertised. My hard boiled eggs taste as good on the 5th day as the first.
5,its great saved money getting it this way on the 4 items
5,"I bought this earlier this summer because I was getting fresh lettuce regularly. Lettuce lasted only a day or so in my refrigerator. Storing it in the 10 cup container has kept it very crisp for weeks now. Every day I have crisp, tasty lettuce."
5,These containers are awesome. First time I have tried these and I love them. Don't wait like I did. Get them now. They will save you a lot of money on spoilage. They did in our house
5,"I am so hooked on this new FoodSaver product line and have gotten my son hooked, also. This is a great size for celery, carrots, parsnips and I eve put salad in it - fits perfectly on the fridge shelf. Things seem to last weeks in these containers. Thank you for such a great product."
5,These containers are of the highest quality!!!!!!!
5,"Bought a few mos ago. Set for each, my friend me. Like that I can use handy seal or machine to vacuum/seal. Helpful see through feature. I froze layers of three different freshly steamed veggies."
5,I had purchased these before so I took advantage of the Food saver sale. These are great. They keep food and produce fresher much longer than the other container. They have kept their seal consistently. I really like that the stack both when filled and empty. Highly recommended. The only thing I don't like is that you have to buy the produce inserts separately.
5,This is the second of this size I have purchased. Very versatile and hold vacuum perfectly.
5,This product is the best at keeping fresh vegetables fresh. I was unsure but bought to try and I am surprised how long and fresh the items have stayed. Another excellent product by Food Saver
5,I bought these FoodSaver Fresh containers last month and they have exceeded my expectations. Love fresh spinach and over 2 weeks in the container and still fresh and great for salads like the day I bought the bag. Same with mixed greens: no more wasted salad fixings in my house. The containers work wonferfully with my V4880 series accessory vacuum pump. Love the machine and now these containers: no more wasted fresh produce.
5,"Loves these. Bought six. I use them for traveling with salads. I used to use mason jars with the jar sealer attachment. That worked pretty good, but meant traveling with glass, and jars are hard to eat out of. With these containers, I've had salads stay fresh for 7 days. These containers seal much easier and faster than the jars. They NEVER lose their seal (mason jars sometimes did, especially when changing elevations). I sealed all of them with and without food to test. I simply could not pull them apart. They are very easy to eat out of and much easier to wash. I love that they are stackable also. The one and only downside is that they take up much more room in a fridge or cooler than a mason jar does. But they hold more also."
5,I have been buying fresh salad which would start to wilt after only a couple of days in the frig. This new Fresh Container kept my salad fresh for a solid 2 weeks after opening and sealing several times.
5,"We have had these for about a month and we always have fresh salad items on hand and available in the refrigerator. These containers stack well in the fridge, seal beautifully, and keeps our fresh vegetables fresh for a long time. I am so happy we purchased these containers. It has saved us from continuously have to go to the store to freshen our salads. Such a good buy as they are sturdy and strong. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a good investment."
5,We love this container. With the additional tray our produce stays nice and crisp for several days. The moisture seeps to the bottom and the food sits above it so it stays crisp and fresh. I especially like putting leftover salad in these containers. No more soggy salad. And I love the button that sucks in when the vacuum is done. It let's me know I've done everything correctly and my food will be fresh. Great sturdy product!
5,"Easy to use, good size. I use it to freeze hamburger rolls--they taste fresh after a month."
5,Salad greens tend to go bad rather quickly. I took a chance that this would keep them fresh for longer than a few days. I actually had fresh salad greens for just over a week. I might buy a second one sometime in the near future.
5,I am finding these containers to be very sturdy and reliable. They have not lost their vacuum. The lids are quite difficult to remove so I use the handle of a pair of scissors to pry the lid off. But anything would work as the plastic is strong enough to be pried apart.
5,Keeps vegetables fresh and crisp over a week.. saves me money too
5,They work soooo much better than the original containers (who don't hold the vacuum)
5,"I live alone and was throwing out a large amount of food. With these containers my lettuce, cheese, fruits and vegetables last a LOT longer. Just remember if it won't seal you have not pushed down around the lid. I am very happy with the product. So happy I ordered another set!"
5,"The NEW FoodSaver 8 cup Fresh Container has not made it into my cabinet. I'm finding myself continuously placing something else in it. I'm to the point where I'm wishing I had another one. I placed strawberries in it on Valentines day and the stayed fresh and very firm until almost St. Patrick's day. I love to keep spinach in the NEW FoodSaver Fresh Containers as they keep it for weeks from getting all slimy. Love these products, well worth the money!"
5,"Purchased some of these containers and they're fabulous. Seal perfectly and much better than previous containers you've sold. Only thing that doesn't seal at all are homemade cookies and don't know exactly why that is. But even so, just putting the lid on securely keeps the cookies fresher than anything else I've tried."
5,"This is the 2nd set I have bought. It has so many great uses 4 just wasn't enough! I have used it for things like cookies, cupcakes, bread, cottage cheese, the uses are endless since you can use it for items on the counter, in the refrigerator and in the freezer! I read a review once when someone commented that they were replacing all their containers with these FoodSaver containers and I can certainly see why! There is just no comparison. The amount of food we didn't have to throw away is worth many times the cost of this set. We even had hamburger buns that stayed fresh for about a month in one of these containers. I will probably be one of those that also wants to replace all my containers with these. They're wonderful and a great investment if you're looking to preserve your food longer and have it stay fresher!"
5,These products are outstanding. I have been able to keep vegetables for two to three weeks.
5,I bought these for the wife She loves them Thanks you for making a great product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,"Bought the food saver for lady I live with, then got 3 sets of the four containers they are great for left overs and keep fruit fresh for allot longer time than tupperware"
5,my salads use to only last 1 week now they last 2 or more weeks everything stays fresh
5,I love this product and believe everyone in the United States should have one. I purchased one for my daughter and will purchase one for my good friend
5,"I have 3 sets and use them regularly. I had trouble getting them to close at first but it is all working great. Spinach and greens have been in fridge for 2 wks , strawberries 3.5 wks. I would definitely recommend to friends."
5,I live 35 miles from a grocery store and have always had a hard time keeing fresh veggies. Now even lettuce stays fresh and crisp from week to week. I will definitely be ordering more. They are also great for lunch meats.
5,The FoodSaver Container Set meets my continued high expectations. It's very useful and easy to use. I really like the fact that I can put it in the dishwasher
5,I can't tell you how much lettuce and fruit I have thrown out in the past due to it going bad. These containers have greatly extended the freshness of our produce. We use our system multiple times per day for a variety of things in bags as well. It has saved us a fortune!
5,I really like these produce trays. They fit perfectly inside the storage containers. So handy to use to keep the food moist.
5,"This keeps food fresh for so long, it is reliable for easy sealing. Fresh containers stack neatly in the refrigerator. I bought it when it was 20 off and has been my best investment! I actually look forward to finding things to use it for. Highly recommended!"
5,"It does what it is designed to do, keeps the veggies out of any moisture on the bottom of the container. Air causes the spoilage of anything but so does moisture. If you must wash the item before you store it, dry them off as much as you can. A spinner will do the job faster. Dry'em, vaccume and you are good to go! I don't know why FS doesn't charge a few bucks more and include the trays with the containers."
5,I've gotten several of the Fresh containers in various sizes. They keep food fresh so much longer. Good investment!
5,These containers work great. I picked marionberries a month ago and they have stayed fresh and ready to eat . Usually the berries start to get moldy after a few days!
5,I purchased two sets of these just within the past month. I use them constantly to keep various foods fresh and mold free. They are excellent products and keep foods longer. Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.
5,These are the best containers. They are made very well and they are dishwasher safe.
5,I love the new containers. They seal well and food stays fresh. Just keeps getting better!!
5,"Improved features such as better quality (durability) plastic,transparency, sealing/vacuuming button, order-free/non-staining plastic, top lid gasket, more user friendly (button dimension of 3,5,8 are uniform), when empty (3,5,8) can be stacked in any combination, refrigerator/freezer (and vice versa) and heat, and many more. The website photo(s) (in my opinion) are misleading to me. In reality I'm able to store MORE due to the improved design/dimensions of the 3 ( 5) cup. I have encountered one drawback (also happens with older containers also), but it is so VERY VERY () inconvenience. I don't get a 100 vacuum EVERY time. This is due to assembly of button, previous uses, washing/drying not completely drying, etc.) causing the button not to close 100 of vacuuming process. So after every vacuuming I listen for a (slight) hissing of air. So nice to have bubble to check vacuuming. I'm VERY HAPPY SATISFIED with the 3 cup (and other size cons.). VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WELL WORTH the .."
5,"I needed these size containers to keep various items from spoiling, as a single person it is now possible to store my cantaloupe, fish and vegetables until I want to cook them in smaller portions. I have not had to throw anything out and prolong the time to cook them. I love these."
5,I love the foodsaver items. I've saved so much not having to throw away spoiled or ruined food.
5,I bought the standing food saver vacuum unit which came with these food saver containers. I like them so well for how easy they are to use and how fresh they keep food that I ordered more of the same.
5,"The first thing I noticed about the containers is how strong they were made. Very heavy weight. When I used the containers the machine took all the air out, I had strawberries keep for a week. Just like the bags but, reusable over and over."
5,works great. just right size for salad items. Keeps food fresh
5,"I've said this before, but it seems to bear repeating. Namely, that I suspect that many of those complaining about these containers losing their vacuum after a few hours -- particularly the 'baby' of the family, this 3 cup one -- must either have a defective unit and should return it, or are stopping the vacuum as soon as the dimple collapses, because ours generally remain sealed..... well...... indefinitely, it seems. Particularly in the freezer. The trick being -- with a hand-held vac, at least -- to keep on vacuuming as the pitch of the motor drops, and to only stop when the pitch starts to rise again, signalling that no more air can be be removed. My only complaint, in fact, being with their 'Freshbucks' program, which tantalizingly offers this 3-cupper for 10,000 points on their site, but have it permanently marked as 'sold out', which rather defeats the purpose of a 'special offer' or 'reward', no!"
5,I just love these containers from food saver. They hold my snacks and keep them fresh till they last. I use the big container to store cilantro in my fridge. I used the mid size for my frozen snack. I just love it he easy use of it. So easy to open the containers and take what I need and vacuum them back again. Thanks food saver. Will definitely buy more when a good deal comes across.
5,I have always had to throw away more half used cucumbers because they go bad so fast once cut. Now with the FoodSaver container I can cut it into useable slices and they keep until I use them all. At least 2 weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
5,"I recently purchased the 8 cup FoodSaver Fresh Container. My family loves boiled peanuts but they do not stay fresh in the refrigerator long enough for us. I tried putting them in the 8 cup container and sealed it, when we opened it a week or so later the peanuts were just as fresh as day one. Love this new container."
5,"The best buy since we got our 3rd FoodSaver. Have stored celery, carrots, bell peppers and more. Stays fresh for weeks instead of days. Cut up several bunches of lettuce for salad and put in one of the new containers. STILL nice and crisp. Celery hearts the same. One bit of advise. When I store veggies I make sure they are DRY before storing them. Any water will cause them to go soggy after a few days. Carrots are washed and dried and not peeled bell peppers are sliced up and patted dry. Cucumbers are washed to remove any wax, sliced, skin on and the are good for a long time. These containers are perfect. Hats off to FoodSaver, they have come a LONG way in the 25 years we have used their products!!!!!"
5,"I use my Food Saver daily for both vacuum bagging food and containers for keeping food fresh. I've tried all the sizes and shapes of containers. The square ones are the best. They stack, they fit more neatly on a shelf. We use them to keep everything from potato buds to cookies and chips fresh. They will keep a bag of chips fresh for weeks when a leaky bag lets them go stale before we can eat them all. Cookies for months. and so on. We can have a variety of chips and cookies open/available at once and without pigging out or getting bored they last when stored in these units."
5,"Love these containers. Got so tired of tossing out food I could not eat fast enough, now, that problem has gone away. Only problem for me is that it is somewhat difficult to lift the lid off after releasing the suction."
5,Love them - they are so much nicer than all previous models and seem to hold the air out better than the others. Greater benefit is that they are stackable. Absolutely would be lost without my FoodSaver containers.
5,"This holds a whole bunch of celery and keeps it super fresh, plus it fits well in the frig."
5,"Bought this when it was Buy one/Get one Free. My husband had been wanting the Marinator. I was able to purchase the 3 piece set and get the Marinator for free. My husband was very excited. So far, we have only used the tall square container, and it worked very well for leftover pasta salad."
5,The clear plastic see through containers are great for allowing you to know exactly what is each container without removing the lid. Keeps food fresh a long time which saves me money a feature I really love.
5,I bought several sizes and they are great. I had veggies that stayed fresh for 3 weeks. I couldn't believe it.. best storage containers I have ever had and they are beautifully designed also .. love it and all Food Saver products
5,"I've used for romaine, spring greens, even melon balls with the tray insert and kept for two weeks. Probably could go longer but we ate them, lol!"
5,"Purchased this 2 piece set a few weeks ago. Works great, keeps food fresh as advertised"
5,"I bought these a few months ago. Two days later I bought another set. I have 8 total. One of the kids stopped vacuuming. From this sight I learned you should clean the valves. That solved it! Works great again! My only complaint is that since the fruit is all washed and cut up, it is easy accessible to my family and they eat it way too quickly!! Haha!"
5,These are so much better than the old ones. Keeps greens fresh much longer than the old ones. Also kept the watermelon and fresh strawberries tasting like I had just prepared them. Nice see through containers and the seal holds real well.
5,"We just got these and really like them as the last time I went to use some of the MAJOR brand stuff I couldn't find a lid that fit, and filled the trash can with all of them.. Just needed to have some of these. they are also best thing is that we vac. them down and stuff inside stays fresh longer in fridge."
5,Purchased my items and received them in record time. Great on service/products.
5,So far I am impressed with how these containers keep produce fresh. Definitely last longer. I'm single so keeping produce fresh longer has the advantage I seek to eating portions over a longer time span.
5,I brought this product and it works just the way it says. Its Strawberry season and fresh fruit last longer in the foodsaver we are very happy.
5,I bought this about a month ago and it's everything they said. I use the larger container for my cigarettes that I roll every week and boy are they fresh. It works great on fresh veggies too. Love my food saver.
5,I bought this set a few weeks ago and also the inserts for the bottom. I really love it!
5,I bought the 3 cup containers about a month ago because it saves me from throwing out good food. I have 5 of them. I'm single and I don't waste food like I use to. Great for left overs.
5,"First I bought the set, then I bought another 8 cup container, then I bought 2 more. Excellent buy. I use them for everything from lettuce to popcorn."
5,I have purchased 15 small and 15 large containers. I am replacing ever plastic and glass container with my new FoodSaver containers and here is why. They work perfectly and stack perfectly in pantry and refrigerator. Will never be without my entire machine and containers.
5,"My biggest disappointment with FoodSaver has been the containers. The older versions we're not durable at all, and the sealing system would fail fairly regularly. I have been using FoodSaver system for about eight years now daily and love it, but have always been disappointed with the containers lack of quality which did not allow the system to work to its full potential. With the new FoodSaver containers all of that is history. At first I started with one of the sets to test them out because they obviously cost more then the old containers. However, the fact that these are made from bpa-free material is great for food safety and the material that is super durable just like the one I use in my big name blender. The new sealing system used with these containers has proven to work. As long as you do the normal procedures by making sure you have a clean container lip before connecting, the seals last. Also, you can use these in the freezer which I have done. The seal holds well and have had not one fail yet in my few month freezer test. Overall I thoroughly enjoy these and just purchased another such as these are now replacing all my containers."
5,I have recently went on weight watchers and a lot of my food was spoiling because I could not eat it fast enough and these containers have saved the day! Now I can buy a variety of foods and don't have to worry about waste.
5,I bought this canister a month ago and am very happy with it. It's great for keeping loose lettuce way longer than just wrapping it in a wet paper towel and placing it back in the produce bag. I highly recommend this product.
5,"Beautifully designed no more mystery leftovers in containers one cannot see through. These are much more effective than the prior generation of FoodSaver containers that have a tendency to lose their vacuum thereby allowing premature spoilage. I've been testing these out since March and have experienced very good results. I have just one request: Please add a container with the same dimensions of the 10 cup version, but with the height of the 8 cup version so I can store a loaf of home made bread in it. THEN the choices will be PERFECT."
5,"Great for veggies, fruit, watermelon, cantaloupe, keeps excellent, ( amazing)"
5,We grow our own veggies purchased the 4 piece set to preserve them they have been wonderful. We kept our salad fresh crispy for nearly 2 weeks. Wow. I'm ordering more.
5,"Love these for storing fresh fruits, veggies and meat. So much less food wasted and I'm not going through gobs of plastic baggies like I used to do (which are not really food-safe anyway). A little bit of a learning curve to get a proper seal, but once you have it ... easy-peasy :-)"
5,"I bought these about a month ago. I am very happy. They are easy to use and the seal is really good. I had to throw away some food before using these, because the food would spoil."
5,I love this product. Its amazing how fresh it keeps my salads other foods. Saving me money by not throwing out food. I highly recommend it.
5,I own two food savers. Love them both. The most recent one is great. Two of my friends bought it because of my recommendations.
5,"I put some watermelon in one of these containers and forgot it for about a week. When I rembererd it I thought oh no what a waste. The suction on that lid was awesome, had to get my hubby to help get it off. But get it off we did, then smelled. Smelled good so we tasted. Tasted good so we ate it, just like Goldilocks, all up. Love these containers."
5,I love the way this keeps fruit fresh. The large size is very useful.
5,I USE THESE ALL THE TIME!!!! LOVE THEM!!!!! THEY WORK AS ADVERTISED!!!!
5,"What a great idea for FoodSaver. I love that this is so compact and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. Very easy to use. You can tell right away that you have a great seal of the container, or need to re-seal it. It will be going to the camper as its easy to transport. Very happy I bought this! I would recommend it!"
5,I am a FOODSAVER Junkie!! (vacuum sealing system) Jan 1 I had a head of ice burg lettuce from Christmas. I cut in wedges and put in the vacuum seal containers. I consumed all but one wedge and left it in the container to see when it got the rusty look. This is what that lettuce looked liked on Feb 2nd. Very little browning and still crispy and edible. Cabbage lasts longer also without browning. It does have a more intense odor being sealed. FOODSAVER is the best for freezing anything. It hardly ever leaks air in and stays vacuum sealed for months. I have used generic bag rolls and they do not seal very well. Throw away more than use. Thought I would share. Keeps food longer in refrigerator and freezer. I have used the FOODSAVER for several years and using my second one now. I have shared this post on Facebook with my friends and getting inquiries. Thanks FOODSAVER!!!!
5,"I bought 2 of these sets, because I knew I was going to use them. Well to test this out I put a green pepper, a cucumber and 2 avocados in containers, now mind you this was a week before Christmas, anyway, I left them in there, well I did use 1 avocado. But just yesterday 1/26/17, I went to see if I could use the green pepper, and oh my gosh, it was fresh like the day I bought it. The cucumber is still in there and when I checked it it was just getting a little soft, just wasn't quite as hard as the first day, but still very usable yet. We'll see avocado is about like the cucumber. Like I said I have 2 sets of these, and most all of the other foodsaver containers. I cleared out my cupboards and only have those in there."
5,I have replaced all plastic and glass containers for these remarkable containers. I have 2 sizes and use them DAILY. No kitchen should be with out them. They look great and stack neatly----try one---you will like it---and properly buy more. These adds do what they say and I will never be without them.
5,"Amazing FoodSaver system has changed my kitchen life... I bought these Blueberries, buy on get one free, so double amount for price of one... I could have never kept fresh for more than a few days and what a waste as they spoil quickly. With the FoodSaver Vacuum sealing containers these will be perfectly fresh for up to two weeks... what a great invention and now I can buy food in quantity to save money too..."
5,"Amazing FoodSaver system has changed my kitchen life... I bought these raspberries, buy on get one free, so double amount for price of one... I could have never kept fresh for more than a few days and what a waste as they spoil quickly. With the FoodSaver Vacuum sealing containers these will be perfectly fresh for up to two weeks... what a great invention and now I can buy food in quantity to save money too..."
5,We went ahead and purchased some of these and gave it the strawberry test. We placed the berry's in the foodsaver container and one week later they were still fresh like the day we bought them. As of now she just placed a ripe cantaloupe in a container to snack on for the next few days and I get the green light to order more containers.
5,"FoodSaver had such a great sale the other month, that I decided to add this to the cart in order to get the (free shipping). These NEW 'Fresh Containers', are WAY BETTER, than the older model containers with the white lids. (5 decent size sandwiches) were made and sealed, to cover the week. I ate them for breakfast, and was planning on them getting me through a 5 day work week. Every morning I grabbed one out, then vacuumed them immediately and back in the fridge. Here is the kicker- I ended up, being called for work, to another city for a week, after eating the 2nd sandwich. I thought there would be NO WAY, they would still be edible when I returned 9 days after originally making them... They were fine, they smelt fine, tasted fine, and I actually ate the last one 13 days after I had made them. I will be purchasing several more of these in the future They seem to be the perfect size, and really hold that vacuum seal. I'm looking forward to also trying the 10 cup 'Fresh Container' for Spinach or Mixed salads to start. (buyer, not free tester)"
5,"Have 4 of these sets and more of the rectangular containers having gotten them during the buy 1 get 1 sale. Recommend getting the little green trays for in the bottom as they really do help (better than a paper towel) to keep moisture or natural juices off of the fruits/veggies. That store bought bag lettuce which last 2-3 days, now last 10-14 days. Kept it that long it just to see! My only problem is: FoodSaver needs to come out with bigger containers to hold a whole head of lettuce, full length celery, and for storing fresh garden vegetables in bulk. Bell peppers are too widehigh for rectangular container 2 won't fit side by side in 8cup container. In response to the person whom said they must re-seal them every few days: I found that running my sealer 5-10 seconds longer helps to assure a perfect seal keeps the little green bubble indented until I open the container."
5,"I bought sever of these and i like them much more than the round ones. These take up less space and are stackable both empty and vacuumed. If the vacumm fails it just need some maintenance to fix. Remove the green cap and push top from the lids then remove the rubber seal and wipe it and the lid under it clean then reassemble. Its like sticking a band aid on a dirty arm, dirt prevents glue from sticking to the skin same principle here only with whatever dust is in the container getting sucked up breaking the seal."
5,I purchased these containers to store my dogs fruits and veggies and it's been only week one but so far they are still fresher than just storing in frig. I also bought several of the other sizes as well . I do recommend these containers for fruits and veggies.
5,already saving me money and the food we eat taste fresh just like it did a day ago or even a week ago. i grill alot and this is great because i cook lots of foods on my grill and when i make too much no problem.
5,these containers keep my fruits and vegetables fresher much longer.
5,"The long container is great to save cut up lettuce not brown or wilted. Can keep so much longer, no waste. I love this"
5,there great have used them now a few times will get more later
5,I am very pleased with all of the New FoodSaver Fresh containers that I have purchased. They really keep things much fresher than the round older containers that FoodSaver makes. I purchased the trays as well and am glad that I did.
5,"I bought this about 4 weeks ago. I have found it to be excellent. The clear sides let you know exactly what is inside. They stack easily in the cupboard or the refrigerator. They vacuum seal in seconds. All mine have held their seal for days. I have not tried them in the freezer yet, but they work well in the microwave. I highly recommend the 5 cup containers."
5,I bought one for myself and loved it so much that I bought one for my 84 year old mother. She has nothing praise. Thank you for the affordable price. Hoping to buy another set for my daughter. You guys are great and gals LOL.
5,I bought this product about a month ago and it keeps my food fresh. My family uses it all the time and I am happy with my purchase.
5,"My husband absolutely loves these containers, they seal up perfectly, and keep everything fresh!"
5,Best vacuum sealing product I've ever bought. You can't find anything in the stores with this state of the art quality. It's good to find a company making a product that does what it's supposed to do.
5,Have been using this container to keep my leftovers in and after being in the refrigerator for several days they still tasted like they had just came out off the stove.
5,"FoodSavers as usual---its just perfect. No more containers. Have ordered 6 large, 12 small, I long. Could not be without. May order more Ben---Naples Florida"
5,"I just told my brother about this product. He buys veggies and fruits in bulk and it goes bad before he can eat it all, so I told him Man do I have the product for you."
5,I bought the set after purchasing a few single other new containers and absolutely love them. They work so well with the trays (that you purchase separately) but are so worth every penny.
5,"I'm so thrilled with these containers that I now have 4 more sets! By showing all my friends Food Saver now has 4 more customer and a 5th ready to order. Oh, and the color matches my kitchen. -)"
5,Like this FoodSaver Fresh Container in the 3-cup size. Need the extra room it provides. Excellent purchase and seals well.
5,I have replaced all plastic and glass containers for these remarkable containers. I have 2 sizes and use them DAILY. No kitchen should be with out them. They look great and stack neatly----try one---you will like it---and properly buy more. These adds do what they say and I will never be without them.
5,"This holds a whole bunch of celery and keeps it super fresh, plus it fits well in the frig."
5,My vegetables lasted three times longer when I started using the Ten Cup Fresh Saver. I also bought the three cup and the five cup. I would recommend selling the bottom parts with the Fresh Savers as they are needed often.
5,We went ahead and purchased some of these and gave it the strawberry test. We placed the berry's in the foodsaver container and one week later they were still fresh like the day we bought them. As of now she just placed a ripe cantaloupe in a container to snack on for the next few days and I get the green light to order more containers.
5,"The best buy since we got our 3rd FoodSaver. Have stored celery, carrots, bell peppers and more. Stays fresh for weeks instead of days. Cut up several bunches of lettuce for salad and put in one of the new containers. STILL nice and crisp. Celery hearts the same. One bit of advise. When I store veggies I make sure they are DRY before storing them. Any water will cause them to go soggy after a few days. Carrots are washed and dried and not peeled bell peppers are sliced up and patted dry. Cucumbers are washed to remove any wax, sliced, skin on and the are good for a long time. These containers are perfect. Hats off to FoodSaver, they have come a LONG way in the 25 years we have used their products!!!!!"
5,All the FoodSaver products I have purchased are great. I love the bags and now these containers. Thanks much!
5,"I've been using these containers since they were first offered for sale. I now have several and use them for fresh fruits, veggies, and a variety of leftovers. They keep the food amazingly fresh. Although they extend the life of the food, it still needs to be used in a reasonable length of time. My raspberries usually stay fresh only a couple of days. The Fresh Saver extends that fresh taste up to a week."
5,"Haven't had a chance to use them yet, but I believe I will find them very useful."
5,"Review: The food saver fresh containers are overall an excellent product, very durable, good style, ultimately keeps food fresh longer. Pros: Keeps food fresh longer Good style Let's you know when it's sealed Works with existing food saver sealers Microwave, dishwasher, freezer safe Cons: Heavier than average container Can be hard to open even with no vacuum seal Somewhat bulky compared to other containers Can be more expensive per container than other solutions This review was collected as part of a promotion."
5,My fresh fruits and veggies last so much longer since I started using the containers. I'm now able to buy more in bulk and thus save money.
5,"I've used for romaine, spring greens, even melon balls with the tray insert and kept for two weeks. Probably could go longer but we ate them, lol!"
