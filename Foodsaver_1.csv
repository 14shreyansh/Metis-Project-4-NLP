1,I am thinking it is ready to use. I did not know I needed to buy more parts to make it work.
1,I bought this a month ago. I tried vacuum sealing and the sealing stays only for 2 or 3 days. I need to reseal it again. Vacuum sealing never stays.
1,"the first one I received would not work at all and it was replaced without any problems (great customer service) the replacement only works for about 24 hours, sometimes. Most of the time it only holds about 30 minutes This review was collected as part of a promotion."
1,I cannot make heads or tails out of how to use this product. You sell parts but not what you need.
1,I have tried to use all and found that none of the containers will hold the vacuum for more than one day. I now have some very expensive regular containers.
1,Seal did not hold. I buy a lot of foodsaver products but I am fixin to be very disappointed in this purchase. I'll try to seal a 2nd time to see if it works.
1,I tried numerous times and it doesn't stay sealed more than 12 hours
1,I did not like the item because the item did not say sealed
1,"We bought this container as part of a package, the other three containers work fine and hold a vacuum. This one did initially and does not even hold a vacuum for a day."
1,"I really liked the earlier versions of these, decided to get the updated ones, as my old ones were scratched up and didn't hold their seal anymore. While they are very well made and easy to clean, they don't hold the air-seal. Seal lasts less than 6 hours ...pretty pointless. I won't be buying FoodSaver canisters anymore. As far as I'm concerned, the only product line of theirs that's reliable are the bags."
1,"I purchased a set which contained this 10C rectangular container and three square containers. The square containers seal beautifully and retain their seal, but this container does not hold the seal at all. As soon as it shows a seal and I remove the sealing tube, I can hear air being sucked into the container. No matter what I try, it will not hold a seal."
1,"I have three of these containers and used them to marinate. they are constructed of hard plastic and every one has cracked which allows air to infiltrate. A different material which is more durable should be used. If this were done, I would not hesitate to again try them."
1,Tried over a dozen of different sizes. Mostly didn't hold the vacuum. Not worth the cost or effort. Best to stick with the single-use bags or mason jar.
1,If you are able to get a seal it will last only one day
1,"When I vacuum this container the little button shows that it's sealed, but when I check it the next day, it shows that it's no longer sealed. Also very difficult to open."
1,After making certain that all sealed surfaces were clean I put on the lids and vacuumed the air from the containers that I used. The vacuum did not hold over three days on either container. The indicator button on the lids even bulged outward indicating built up off-gas from the food (strawberries).
1,"I've only been able to get these to seal once and hold the seal. I've washed all the parts, made sure there was no debris anywhere, it's so frustrating. I love the idea of them because they are clear, and heavy duty, I just can't make them seal."
1,I have several of these new containers and none of them hold seal longer than 24 hrs. They are not a bad container if you don't need airtight.
1,"Will not stay sealed, can't tell if it's shut tight. But never purchase another one. And when I started this purchase I want Will not stay sealed, can't tell if it's shut tight. Will never purchase another one. And when I started this purchase I warm the whole set the whole set."
1,after a few months mine does not hold the vacuum. I only use in to store homemade granola store them above my kitchen wall cabinets away from heat sun light. Of all of their container products the only one that I can keep working are the vac seal zip lock bags!
1,Containers are very hard to open after releasing the suction. The small suction piece is lose so easy to get lost and no where to store that. Also difficult to get the suction going because of the short stiff tube.
1,"When placed in frig, after a few hours, the seal is lost."
1,I bought the new containers the seals don't hold well. The lids don't ever feel like they snap on correctly I believe that may be part of the problem with the seals not holding longer than a day.
1,I gave it one star because after abut 10 min trying to get the air vacuumed out it wouldn't seal so I gave up. And I printed off more detailed instructions on how to seal it. Once I have gone thru the printed instructions i will see how well it does and change my review
1,The only container that held the seal was the smallest. The other 3 larger containers sometimes held the seal for a day and as little as an hour! I returned them within a week and will not purchase them again.
1,I have been using this set for berries. For some reason moisture forms inside the container and it loses the seal. However when it does hold the seal and I release the pressure I almost have to pry open the lid it is so hard to get off. I would not buy again
1,I bought this about a month ago and two lids have already cracked. We do not freeze out containers. We have been using foodsaver containers for years. Not very happy with two lids already cracking.
1,"I have had a Foodsaver for a long time, and I use the containers exclusively. I have invested a small fortune in the original containers. I was really excited when I saw these new ones, and bought this set immediately. I love the fact that they are square, stackable, freezer and dishwasher safe. Those are the good attributes. The bad ones are that they take a ridiculously long time to seal. I don't know if it's my foodsaver or not, but the large container takes about 4 minutes to seal......no joke. And then the biggest let down is that they are not reliable in holding a seal, which is the main reason that I use them. There are so many amazing reviews about them. Am I they only one this happens to That seems so odd............"
1,I bought a set of 3 containers about 6 months ago to store fresh picked berries for a short time until we processed them. The vacuum usually held ok for a few days but a couple of times it didn't. When there's no vacuum the lids don't say on and when you lift the container from the top the bottom falls off an everything ends up on the floor. After berry season we have been using them just as normal refrigerator storage containers without using the vacuum. They are absolutely useless as regular storage containers because the lids don't stay on. These are too expensive to use only as vacuum storage.
1,I bought this a little over a month ago. I have trouble getting it to seal and it never holds the seal very long. Usually 24 hours or less is all it is good for. Quite expensive for something that my old Tupperware out performs. Really disappointed.
1,"I bought the clear containers. I vacuum seal them, and later find that the seal has not held. Leaves me with nothing but an expensive plastic container."
1,"I have tried everything to get these containers to hold a vacuum seal but they only seem to do so for a very short period of time. After several frustrating months of trying to get them to work, I went back to the old canisters (that work great until the bottom splits)."
1,"I sealed all four containers with dry ingredients, none of them kept the seal more than three days. This is a shame! the old smoked gray containers would keep a seal for literally years. The new containers do not keep a seal at all. I'm surprised they can even sell these new things And claim that they keep things fresh. You might as well use the zip lock bag. They do not work as advertised. They do not seal for more than two days. The bags work well, The machine works well, but the containers are abysmal. Ever since they got rid of the smoked containers (You can't buy them anymore), You have to use Mason jars."
1,"doesn't work,,,,,,when they work they are great but when they don't work they are just expensive ugly bowls"
1,I bought the whole set a few months ago... one out of the set worked....they sent me a whole new set ...one worked....now they just sit in my cupboard. I dont have the heart to throw them out... I so wanted them to work great idea lousy manufacturing
1,I don't know how to use them with the Foodsaver. Seems like something is missing.
1,Bought four pieces. The container will not stay sealed.
1,I purchased two 3 piece sets just like this minus the 10 cup container and they seal initially and lose the seal overnight or within a day or two. I have washed and dried every single piece including the gaskets and I continue to end up with a broken seal and spoiled food. I would not recommend these particular containers.
1,I have two of the larger size 10 cup containers that I purchased a year ago. Both have cracks in the tops and will not hold a seal.
1,Bought 2 of these for dry food storage and the lids require a lot of strength to lock in place. Once locked I used to Freshsaver to seal to container. The dimple would show that the vacuum was pulling out the air but about 30 seconds after sealing the air would leak back in through the release button which did not hold a seal for either of the 2 containers I bought. Attempted to make these work for a couple weeks but no success. Intending to return for a refund. Total waste.
1,I was so excited when I bought these. I even bought two sets. They don't work for lettuce or strawberry. That's what I bought them for. First time I have EVER not liked a food saver product
1,"I bought several of the new square Fresh Containers 2 months ago. I am very disappointed with them - They do not always hold the seal, but when they do, they are very difficult to open. On one occasion when the seal finally opened, the container turned sideways spilling the contents all over the counter and floor. I will stick with the older round vacuum containers."
1,"I bought this not even a month ago and returned them yesterday, upon my first use. Or should I say tried to used. I couldn't snap the covers on as it said to do, had my husband try with all his weight, still could not snap the lids."
1,"My FoodSaver was working fine until I purchased accessories. I was hoping this was the answer to keeping lettuce and spinach fresher after purchasing the large size bags. After the first vacuum sealing, now my FoodSaver will not turn on at all without unplugging the power cord and replugging it into another outlet. Disappointed!"
